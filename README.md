# World Happiness Index Analysis

"Happiness is not by chance, but by choice." 

Although considered a very subjective term, happiness can actually be objectified through the Happiness Index. Happiness Index is defined as a survey tool that measures happiness, well-being, and features of sustainability and resilience.We are constantly numbed by distractions. In our busy fact paced world especially when living that hard city life we fail to evaluate the choices we make and how it has a direct impact on our living.

The aim of the project is to take an analytical view at various factors like obesity, pollution levels and their impact on happiness in some major metropolitan cities. We first examine the variables in the given dataset. Based on that comprehensive overview we build a best fit regression model choosing suitable variables and transformations to explain the happiness index. Finally, we interpet the statistical results and conclude our analysis.
